# Digital_gym_system

A Digital gym system using agile development methods.  
The target of this system is to apply the knowledge from Software Engineering to build this product based solely on Java.  
The project is now ended after the final dilevery, the repository will be archived from now on.  

## How to run the program

You can run the program via IDE or command line application.

### Run the program in IDE

To run the program in IDE, you can open the folder as a project in a java ide (IDEA, vscode, eclipse).  
Then run the _Main_ class _main_ method.

### Run the program in command line

To run the program in command line, you should first enter the source folder of the project.  
Then run the following command to compile the program:  
\> javac -cp . ./exceptions/\*.java  
\> javac -cp . ./\*.java  
After, the program is compiled properly, to run the program, use:  
\> java Main  

The version of _java_ should not be older than _javac_, or Runtime class will throw an Exception before running.  

## How to run the test method

To run the test method, you should move the _JUnitTest_  in test method to source folder.  
If you are using IDE, you can add JUnit5.7 dependency. We highly recommend you
to use IDE to run the JUnit test.
